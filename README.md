## 👋 Hi, I'm Martin

**3D Environment Artist | Unity "Developer" | Trail Runner**

🎮 **Game Dev with a Touch of Adventure**
I try to bring immersive environments to life in Unity-bridging, realistic and stylized art, animation, and code to create playable worlds blending visual storytelling with technical execution.

🛠 **Tech Stack & Tools**

* Engines: Unity (URP, HDRP, WebGL, VR) Unreal 
* DCC: Blender, 3Ds Max, Substance Painter, Zbrush
* Rokoko SmartSuit Pro 2 (Mocap)
* Git & GitHub (Pages, Actions)



📦 **Projects currently active**

* 🛣️ `Roadplay`: An animated city-rug simulation published on GitHub Pages [🔗Roadplay repository ](https://github.com/martin-mikulic/Roadplay)
* 🚗 `Golf 2 Country`: Custom mod for *SnowRunner* with Syncro 4x4 (still private)


🌍 **Currently Exploring**

* 2.5D Platformers (inspired by *Captain Claw*)
* Unity WebGL optimizations for mobile
* Procedural environment generation

📸 **Snapshots of My World**
Outside of dev, you'll find me running trails or recreating nostalgic worlds - like turning children's road rugs into explorable dioramas.

📬 **Let’s Collaborate**
Open to freelance gigs, collabs, and cool creative ideas. Reach out if you need a unique environment brought to life.
